        b) Second install VMware Workstation pro (link given belo ,version 14 is having some known issues) 
        c) Third install GNS3 VM (link given below)
        d) Now open VMware workstation and import GNS3 VM 
        e) Go to GNS3 GUI, EDIT, PREFERENCE, GNS3 VM --> Tick on Enable the GNS3 VM, apply and save
        f) Install/Add Network Automation appliance (which is having ansible pre-installed) 
        g) Add an ethernet switch (with GNS3 vm, not with local PC) and one cisco IOSv router, also add a nat cloud (which will provide a DHCP IP's to all appliances)
        h) Now on the network appliance (edit /etc/network/interfaces) to have a DHCP IP from NAT CLOUD, stop and start the appliance again and you will see the ip
